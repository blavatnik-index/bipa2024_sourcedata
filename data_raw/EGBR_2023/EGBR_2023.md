## About the data

The eGovernment Benchmark Report (eGBR) is a annual report  published by the
European Commission that assesses the functionality of over 5,000 public sector
websites across the European Union and "neighbourhood" countries. It uses a
"life events" model to measure the most important/common interactions citizens
and businesses have with government and public services and the provision of
those services online.

The eGBR uses a mystery shopping exercise to review the availability of
information and services, the transparency of the service delivery process and
the use of "key enabler" technologies. In addition to mystery shopping,
automated assessment of the websites is conducted to measure their
"findability" via search engines, their page loading speeds, adherence to
common web security policies and compliance with WCAG accessibility standards.

Although published annual, the assessment process occurs on a biennial cycle
with some "life events" collected in even years and others in odd years.

## Processing notes

The raw data is reprocessed by the Blavatnik Index of Public Administration
to focus only on websites relating to activities carried out by national
government entities.

For the mystery shopping assessments, a score is first
calculated for each website for each aspect (availability of information,
availability of services, transparency of service delivery, and use of key
enablers), websites are coded by life event and an average is calculated for
each aspect by country-life event pairing, an overall score for each aspect is
then calculated as an average of these country-life event scores. This is to
account for the fact that some life events have more websites and/or stages
assessed than others and that this varies by country.

For the technical assessments the life events are ignored and it is a simple
average of the relevant assessment scores for each website by country.
