## Processing notes

The World Bank’s GovTech Maturity Index (GTMI) provides a detailed assessment
of national governments digital government policies, technologies and digital
public services. The high-level results of the GTMI are outputs from a factor
analysis of the raw input data, it is therefore not easy to directly identify
from the overall results how countries can take action. Furthermore, in
addition to its own questionnaire (completed by government officials or World
Bank researchers in the case of non-response) the GTMI incorporates some data
from other sources which are either already used by the Blavatnik Index of
Public Administration (in the case of the ITU’s Global Cybersecurity Index) or
have been rejected for inclusion (components of the UN’s E-Government
Development Index). The GTMI data is therefore re-processed to extract its
own aggregates of the original raw data.

The re-processing of the GTMI data also enables the allocation of data
collected by the GTMI survey to relevant parts of the Index's conceptual
framework:

- data on open data, open government and citizen participation are
  allocated to the "openness and communications" theme
- data on internal administrative IT systems are allocated to the "technology
  and workplaces" theme
- data on innovation strategies and practices are allocated to the "innovation"
  theme
