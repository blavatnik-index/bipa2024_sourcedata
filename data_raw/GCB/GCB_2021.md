## About the data

Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer was an international
public opinion survey carried out between  and 2017, since 2107 it has been
conducted on a regional basis. The survey asks members of the public about
their perceptions and experiences of corruption across society and the economy.

One question in the survey asks respondents about how many government officials
they think are involved in corruption (none, some, most, or all), the proportion
saying most or all is extracted for inclusion in the Blavatnik Index of Public
Administration.

## Processing notes

The source data for different regions is stored in either an Excel spreadsheet
providing an overall summary of survey responses or statistical data files
containing the raw data responses. From the Excel spreadsheet the summary value
for most/all officials are involved in corruption is extracted, or if not
available the values for most and all are added together to calculate this
summary. From the statistical data files, the weighted proportions for all
responses to the question are calculated, the figures for most/all are then
added together.
