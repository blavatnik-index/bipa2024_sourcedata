## Processing notes

While similar to the OBS headline measures the Blavatnik Index processing of
the source data makes some variations, most notably it includes audit documents
within its oversight measure (these are included in the OBS' transparency
measure), it also includes the assessments of independent fiscal institutions
(IFIs) in its oversight measure.
