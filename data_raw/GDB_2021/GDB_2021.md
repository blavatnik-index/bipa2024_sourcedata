## About the data

The Global Data Barometer (GDB) is a successor to the World Wide Web
Foundation's Open Data Barometer. It is produced by the
[Data 4 Development Network](https://www.d4d.net) and
[ILDA](https://idatosabiertos.org/). The GDB collects assessments by civil
society researchers of national government's open data availability and
practices.

## Processing notes

The D4D.net and ILDA Global Data Barometer attributes its underlying data to
both 4 “pillars” (availability, capability, governance, and use and impact)
and 7 “modules” (capabilities, climate action, company information, governance,
health & covid, land, political integrity, public finance, and public
procurement).

The processing of the Global Data Barometer extracts and aggregates the data
for each of the governance and capabilities pillars to create two overall
scores for each country, it then aggregates the remaining data on availability
and use & impact by module to create seven further scores for each country
relating to each module.
