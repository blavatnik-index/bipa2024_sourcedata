## About the data

Doing Business was a study produced by the World Bank from 2004 to 2020 that
aimed to measure business regulations for local firms in 190 economies. It
has been replaced by the *B-Ready* report, however this was not available at
time of the Index calculation and production.

national and sub-national data.

## Processing notes

Data for sub-national entities (e.g. cities/regions) has been excluded. Data
for national level entities has been filtered to exclude 8 economies with
outlier values that skew the scaling of the variable from 0 to 1. The outlier
threshold (590 hours) is calculated after excluding sub-national entities, and
is calculated as the mean value for all national entities plus two times the
standard deviation for all national entities:
234 hours + (178 hours * 2) = 590 hours.
