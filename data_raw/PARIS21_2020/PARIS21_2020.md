## About the data

The Statistical Capacity Monitor is a project of the PARIS21 consortium, hosted
by the OECD that aims to "describe global, regional and national statistical
capacity". The SCM re-uses data from a number of other sources, including the
Open Data Inventory (ODIN) which is used directly by the Blavatnik Index, as
well as its own research.

It has a measure on the use of statistics in national policy documents which is
extracted and used by the Blavatnik Index - Measuring References to Statistics
in National Policy Documents (2021),
https://www.paris21.org/knowledge-base/measuring-references-statistics-national-policy-documents.
